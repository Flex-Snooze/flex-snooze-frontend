## Project Description 
Flex Five - a browser-based full stack tool coded in React using JavaScript and CSS, featuring an API managed using MongoDB, Mongoose and Node.js.

This tool was designed for users to log their workouts. This application will recommend an assortment of workouts and specific weight lift moves based on user preference, with the ability to cycle through options. Users are also able to log a custom workout of their choice. This app was designed with mobile first styling as users would most likely leverage the app on-the-go.
