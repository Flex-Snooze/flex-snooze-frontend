Flex-Five-Workout App 

Planning Stages - For entire App

First step involved prototyping front-end layout. This included Prototype Wireframe sketches for App Layout, Front-End React,Component Structure and  Back-End API Structure Endpoints and Directory Naming Convention.


The sketches component structure and backend structure were shared and discussed in a team meeting. The team collaborated and edited some of the vision’s of the app’s design as a team. 


The app had a initial vision of containing a calendar that would organize and display data to the user. This idea was refactored because the integration of a front end calendar with a back end MongoDB had a high chance of delaying the production of the application within the 6 day deadline.


The basic functionality of the app did not differ much from the planning stages the look and layout of the app was adapted more to more simplistic mobile-first approach. Which increases usability of the app in a gym setting.

The Five-Five Component Structure was altered slightly as the project progress as functionality of the app was hashed out by project team.

The project was wireframed and was used as a rough guide for app development.
The initial design was refactored to a more simplistic and mobile friendly approach which could be implemented in tablet and desktop view without the need of a media queries.

The app’s development lead to a mobile first layout and design. The calendar approach was abandoned and a simple more user friendly for the app’s functionality. A  custom workout button and form was integrated, so the user can have the freedom of adding a custom workout to the log. The information is saved for the user to have access to the log in the dashboard screen at any time.
